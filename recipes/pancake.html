        <h2>2-Ingredient Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Since a single banana is the main ingredient, these pancakes do indeed taste like bananas. Not aggressively (in my opinion), but even so, if you don’t really love banana-flavored things, then you probably won’t love this recipe.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium ripe banana</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Butter or oil, for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the banana in a medium bowl. Aim for a paste-like consistency with no big chunks. <br>

                Crack the eggs into the banana. Whisk the eggs and incorporate them gradually into the banana. The batter should be loose and liquidy, similar in consistency to regular pancake batter. If you want any extra flavorings in your pancake, now’s the time to add those!</li>
            <li>Start cooking the pancakes: <br>
                Heat a nonstick frying pan over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles on contact. Add a little butter or oil to the pan and swirl it around. <br>
                
                Drop spoonfuls of the pancake batter into the pan, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Leave some space between the pancakes so you have space to flip them. The batter should sizzle on contact; if not, turn up the heat slightly. <br>
                
                Cook until the pancakes look dry and golden brown when you lift a corner with a spatula, about 1 minute. Sprinkle any toppings on the uncooked surface of your pancakes now.</li>
            <li>Flip: <br>
                Flip the pancakes by gently sliding a thin spatula under the pancake and turning it over onto an open part of the pan. If any batter spills as you do this, just nudge it back into shape with your spatula. <br>
                
                Cook until both sides are golden brown, another 1 to 2 minutes. You can flip the pancakes a few times if they’re not quite as golden as you’d like.</li>
            <li>Serve: <br>
                Eat immediately, topped with maple syrup, jam, or anything you like. If you’d like to serve everyone at once, you can keep the cooked pancakes warm on a sheet pan in a low oven until you’re ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
