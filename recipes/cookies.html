        <h2>Monster Cookies with confetti</h2>
        <p>Monster cookies are soft-baked, peanut butter-based cookies loaded up with oats, chocolate chips, and M&Ms. They’re crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. This version is flourless, relying on peanut butter and oats to create an irresistible texture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (255g) creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature </li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 cups (260g) quick-cooking oats</li>
            <li>1 cup M&Ms</li>
            <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
                Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>Cream the peanut butter, butter, and sugars:
                In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together the peanut butter, butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides halfway through.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and vanilla:
                Stop the mixer and add both eggs and the vanilla. Beat for 2 minutes on medium speed. It will look like a thick paste.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients and mix-ins:
                Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides. Add the baking soda and salt and beat for 30 seconds more.
                
                Add the oats and mix on low speed until fully combined.
                
                Reserve 2 tablespoons each of the M&Ms and chocolate chips and add the remainder to the oat mixture. Stir by hand with a spatula and combine thoroughly. </li>
            <li>Scoop and bake:
                Use a heaping medium cookie scoop or spoon to portion the dough into 1 1/2-inch balls (for a total of 22 or so balls) and place them at least 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Then, using your hands, roll them into uniform balls and press the reserved M&Ms and chocolate chips onto the tops of each cookie dough ball.
                
                Bake until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes, rotating the pans halfway.</li>
            <li>Cool and serve:
                Let cookies rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before using a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.
                
                Once the cookies have cooled completely, store them in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. They can also be frozen for up to 2 months.</li>
        </ol>
